# CGPA Calculator Application

## Overview üìö
The CGPA Calculator is a Java-based application designed to help students calculate their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) efficiently. Developed using Java and the Swing framework, the application provides a user-friendly interface for entering academic data and obtaining an accurate representation of overall academic performance.

## Features ‚ú®
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features an intuitive GUI developed using Java Swing, making it easy for users to input their academic data.
- **Accurate CGPA Calculation:** It calculates CGPA using weighted averages based on the credits and grades provided by the user.
- **SGPA Integration:** Users can also input the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and total credits from previous semesters, which are factored into the CGPA calculation.
- **Input Validation:** The application validates user inputs, ensuring that all data is correctly formatted and within the expected ranges.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages are displayed for incorrect inputs, guiding the user to correct their entries.
- **Reset Functionality:** Users can reset the inputs and perform multiple calculations within the same session.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### Core Functionality
The CGPA Calculator operates through a series of input prompts and validations:

1. **Subject Entry:**
   - Users specify the number of subjects.
   - For each subject, users enter the credit points and the score obtained out of 10.
   
2. **Previous Semesters Entry:**
   - Users can enter the number of previous semesters for which they want to include SGPA.
   - For each previous semester, users input the SGPA and total credits.

3. **GPA Calculation:**
   - The application calculates the CGPA using the formula and then displayed to the user.
     
$$
\text{CGPA} = \frac{\text{Total Grade Points (current + previous semesters)}}{\text{Total Credits (current + previous semesters)}}
$$

4. **Iteration:**
   - After displaying the result, the application prompts the user if they want to perform another calculation or exit.


### Key Functions
- **`calculateGPA()`**: Main function for computing the CGPA based on user inputs.
- **`getInput(String message, String errorMessage)`**: Method for obtaining a double input from the user.
- **`getInput1(String message, String errorMessage)`**: Method for obtaining an integer input from the user.
- **`resetInputs()`**: Resets the input fields and prepares the application for another calculation round.
- **`showError(String errorMessage)`**: Displays error messages in a dialog box.
- **`showExit(String exitMessage)`**: Displays an exit message when the application is closed.
